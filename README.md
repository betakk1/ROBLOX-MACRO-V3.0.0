## FAQ
**Is this a Cheat?**
- No, this is a macro utility. It simulates user input and does not interact with Roblox's memory or game processes in any way that would be considered cheating. It automates in-game actions through external input.

**Windows Defender flags it as a virus!**
- This is a known false positive. Some PC's flag it, but most don't. I'm consistently trying to fix false positives. If you still don't trust it, you can download Visual Studio 2022 with the "Desktop C++" workload, open the .sln project file from the GitHub source code, and compile it yourself.

**I bound a macro to left-click by mistake!**
- To fix this, press down the "Toggle Macro" button in the app. Then, drag your mouse cursor back over the UI's Toggle button and release your mouse. This will toggle off the macro.
